# CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD Pipeline** is a GitHub Actions workflow designed to automate the process of continuous integration and continuous deployment, ensuring that code changes are automatically tested and deployed. This pipeline focuses on streamlining the development process, improving code quality, and accelerating delivery.

## Features

- **Automated Testing**
  - Runs unit tests and integration tests on every push and pull request.
  - Supports multiple testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha, PyTest).

- **Code Quality Checks**
  - Linting and formatting checks to ensure code consistency.
  - Static code analysis to identify potential issues.

- **Build Automation**
  - Automatically builds the project for various environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
  - Supports Docker for containerized builds.

- **Deployment Automation**
  - Deploys to multiple environments (e.g., staging, production) based on branch rules.
  - Supports deployment to cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

- **Notifications**
  - Sends notifications for build and deployment statuses via email, Slack, or other messaging platforms.

- **Rollback Mechanism**
  - Automatic rollback to the previous stable version in case of deployment failure.

---

## Usage

1. **Setting Up the Pipeline**
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
   - Add a YAML file defining your workflow (e.g., `ci-cd-pipeline.yml`).

2. **Configuring Tests**
   - Define the testing steps in your workflow file.
   - Specify the testing frameworks and scripts to run.

3. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Add linting and formatting checks to your workflow.
   - Configure static code analysis tools.

4. **Building the Project**
   - Define the build steps in your workflow.
   - Use Docker for containerized builds if necessary.

5. **Deploying the Project**
   - Configure deployment steps for different environments.
   - Set up secrets and environment variables for deployment.

## How It Works

### Workflow Structure

- **Triggers**
  - Workflow is triggered on push and pull request events.

- **Jobs**
  - **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests.
  - **Lint**: Checks code for linting and formatting issues.
  - **Build**: Builds the project for the target environment.
  - **Deploy**: Deploys the build to the specified environment.

- **Notifications**
  - Sends build and deployment status notifications.

### Example Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: true
          tags: user/app\:latest

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, lint, build]
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: ./deploy.sh
```
